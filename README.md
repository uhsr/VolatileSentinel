# VolatileSentinel - Dynamic Memory Anomaly Detection

VolatileSentinel is a Rust-based utility designed for real-time monitoring and detection of memory anomalies within running processes. It provides a robust and efficient mechanism for identifying potential memory leaks, buffer overflows, and other memory-related issues that can compromise application stability and security. VolatileSentinel is engineered to be lightweight, performant, and easily integrated into existing development workflows, offering developers a valuable tool for proactive memory management and debugging.

This tool leverages Rust's safety features and powerful memory management capabilities to analyze memory usage patterns and identify deviations from expected behavior. Unlike traditional memory profiling tools that often rely on post-mortem analysis, VolatileSentinel operates in real-time, providing immediate feedback on memory anomalies as they occur. This enables developers to quickly pinpoint the source of memory issues and implement corrective measures before they escalate into more significant problems. The core philosophy is to provide a sentinel, always vigilant, for volatile memory states.

VolatileSentinel achieves its real-time monitoring capabilities by utilizing a combination of process introspection, memory scanning, and statistical analysis. It can be configured to monitor specific memory regions within a process, track memory allocation and deallocation patterns, and generate alerts when anomalies are detected. These alerts can be customized based on severity and trigger specific actions, such as logging the event, generating a diagnostic report, or even terminating the process to prevent further damage. The goal is to empower developers with the tools they need to maintain the integrity and stability of their applications in dynamic memory environments.

Key Features:

*   Real-time Memory Monitoring: Continuously monitors specified memory regions within a target process, providing immediate feedback on memory usage patterns. This is achieved by leveraging the `ptrace` system call and safely reading memory regions.

*   Anomaly Detection: Employs statistical analysis techniques, such as moving averages and standard deviation, to detect deviations from expected memory behavior. The specific algorithms used are configurable via the command-line.

*   Configurable Alerting: Allows developers to define custom alert thresholds and actions to be triggered when memory anomalies are detected. This includes logging to file, sending network notifications, and process termination.

*   Process Introspection: Uses process ID (PID) to attach to and inspect target processes, gathering information about their memory mappings and allocation patterns. The `procfs` crate is used for parsing `/proc/[pid]/maps`.

*   Memory Region Filtering: Provides the ability to filter memory regions based on criteria such as address range, permissions, and mapping name. This allows for focused monitoring of specific areas of interest.

*   Customizable Scanning Intervals: Allows users to define the frequency at which memory regions are scanned, balancing performance with the need for timely anomaly detection. Adjust the `--scan-interval` argument.

*   Minimal Performance Overhead: Designed to minimize the impact on the performance of the target process, ensuring that monitoring does not introduce significant overhead. This is achieved through efficient memory scanning and optimized analysis algorithms.

Technology Stack:

*   Rust: The primary programming language, chosen for its safety, performance, and memory management capabilities.
*   libc: Provides access to low-level system calls, such as `ptrace`, which are essential for process introspection and memory manipulation.
*   procfs: Used for parsing information from the `/proc` filesystem, enabling the retrieval of memory maps and other process-related data.
*   clap: Used for parsing command-line arguments and configuring the application.
*   log and env_logger: Provide a flexible logging framework for recording events and debugging issues.

Installation:

1.  Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  Clone the VolatileSentinel repository: `git clone https://github.com/uhsr/VolatileSentinel.git`
3.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd VolatileSentinel`
4.  Build the project: `cargo build --release`
5.  The executable will be located in the `target/release` directory.

Configuration:

VolatileSentinel can be configured using command-line arguments and environment variables.

*   Target Process ID (PID): Specify the process to monitor using the `--pid` argument. Example: `--pid 1234`
*   Scan Interval: Define the frequency at which memory regions are scanned using the `--scan-interval` argument (in milliseconds). Example: `--scan-interval 1000`
*   Memory Regions: Specify the memory regions to monitor using the `--address-range` argument. Example: `--address-range 0x40000000-0x40001000`
*   Alert Thresholds: Configure the threshold for anomaly detection using the `--threshold` argument. Example: `--threshold 0.1`
*   Log Level: Set the log level using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. Example: `export RUST_LOG=info`

Usage:

To run VolatileSentinel, execute the following command from the `target/release` directory:

./VolatileSentinel --pid <process_id> --scan-interval <interval_ms> --address-range <start_address>-<end_address> --threshold <anomaly_threshold>

Example:

./VolatileSentinel --pid 5678 --scan-interval 500 --address-range 0x7f2345678000-0x7f234567a000 --threshold 0.05

This command will monitor process 5678, scanning the memory region between 0x7f2345678000 and 0x7f234567a000 every 500 milliseconds, and trigger an alert if the memory usage deviates from the expected behavior by more than 5%. Log messages will be output to the console based on the `RUST_LOG` environment variable setting.
